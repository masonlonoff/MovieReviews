## Description
IMDB dataset having 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics.
This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. So, predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms.


## Objectives:
1) Attempt to accurately calculate the sentiment of each review using VADER
2) Utilize Aspect Extraction and Emotional Analysis to get a deeper understanding of each review
3) Use Topic Modeling to classify each review

   
## Strategic Plan of Action:
1) Sentiment Analysis with Word Clouds
2) Sentiment Analysis but incorporate Aspect Extraction and Emotional Analysis
3) Perform Topic Modeling
